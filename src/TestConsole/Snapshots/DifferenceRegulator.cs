    /// deterministic. Therefore unpredictable values must be hidden and replaced with a consistent representation. There are other pitfalls that must also
    /// be navigated - for example, sorting by random values will change the order of results, which will also result in non-deterministic results (e.g. if
    /// we sort GUIDS used as keys, the first new value will potentially belong to a different row every test run). Therefore, we must process the keys in
    /// the order they were presented to the snapshot when substituting values. This requires us to be able to see all of the snapshots in order to determine
    /// which snapshot originated the key, as well as seeing the differences themselves.

    /// <para/>
    /// It should also be apparent that it is not possible to use the original value to generate the substitution. Apart from truly random data, we do not
    /// want to exclude the use of the library in acceptance tests, in which the keys seen may originate in an external data store, and may be incrementing
    /// from an unknown start point. This means that keys with a simple data type, such as Integer, need the same approach as GUIDs or hashes.
    /// <para/>
    /// In order to show relationships within the difference output, we also need to be aware when a field value in one table references a key value from
    /// another. This visibility of association puts a burden on the user code table definition that needs to be resolved.
