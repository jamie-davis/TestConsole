     * Notes about splitting text for wrapping:
     * 
     * Initially, the problem was splitting plain text. It was simple, because white space was simply a seperator for words,
     * and the blanks could therefore be assigned to the word that precedes them and they could later be dropped if the word
     * is last on the line.
     * 
     * However, introducing colour instructions adds a great deal of complexity.
     * 
     * For example:
     * 
     * "The dog   ate the cat."
     * 
     * Becomes:
     * 
     * The:1
     * dog:3
     * ate:1
     * the:1
     * cat.:0
     * 
     * (In this notation, the text is followed by a colon, and then the number of spaces that seperate the word from the next.)
     * 
     * Consider the same text with added colour:
     * 
     * "The " + "dog   ".BGBlue() + "ate".BGRed() + " the " + "cat".BGYellow() + "."
     * 
     * Here some of the text has a coloured background. "dog" has blue, "ate" has red and "cat" has yellow.
     * 
     * Consider "dog". The word is trailed by 3 blue background spaces. What does that actually mean
     * Essentially it means that if the spaces exist, they are blue.
     * 
     * Consider "ate" and " the ". If the space between "ate" and "the" exists, it is not coloured.
     * 
     * In the "dog" case, if we simply have:
     * 
     * (Colour instructions have been represented like XML for clarity, which is an approximation, not a reflection of reality.)
     * <blue>dog</blue>:3
     *
     * This would not result in blue spaces.
     * 
     * By contrast:
     * 
     * <red>ate</red>:1
     * 
     * Does exactly what we want. The space following "ate" is not coloured.
     * 
     * So, the problem is that the very specific arrangement of the colour instructions is crucial to rendering the text as
     * requested when it is wrapped.
     * 
     * There is more trouble here:
     * 
     * " ".BGRed() + " ".BGGreen() + " ".BGBlue()
     * 
     * This is presumably a request for three coloured blocks. The splitter would need to return:
     * 
     * <red> </red>:0
     * <green> </green>:0
     * <blue> </blue>:0
     * 
     * But spaces are interpreted as gaps between words, and are not "output" in the same way as other characters. Therefore
     * the splitter wants to attach them to words and treats them as optional.
     * 
     * Also:
     * 
     * "word".Red() + " more data".Blue()
     * 
     * If the line were to be broken after "word", the space preceding "more data" would be dropped. However, that space is
     * adjacent (read includes) the "blue foreground" formatting, and dropping that would mean "more data" is not rendered
     * in blue.
     * 
     * Therefore a very different approach is needed.
     * 
     * It would be better if words and whitespace were seperate. Whitespace must be able to carry formatting instructions.
     * When whitespace is omitted, the formatting instructions should not be. Whitespace runs are valid when they carry 
     * different formatting instructions. It would not be incorrect to split words on formatting instructions.
     * 
     * For example:
     *
     * "The dog   ate the cat."
     * 
     * Becomes:
     * 
     * The
     * <space:1>
     * dog
     * <space:3>
     * ate
     * <space:1>
     * the
     * <space:1>
     * cat.
     * 
     * "word".Red() + " more data".Blue()
     * 
     * Becomes:
     * <red>word</red>
     * <blue><space:1>
     * more
     * <space:1>
     * data</blue>
     * 
     * " ".BGRed() + " ".BGGreen() + " ".BGBlue()
     * 
     * <red><space:1></red>
     * <green><space:1></green>
     * <blue><space:1></blue>
     * 
     * "The " + "dog   ".BGBlue() + "ate".BGRed() + " the " + "cat".BGYellow() + "."
     * 
     * Becomes:
     * 
     * The
     * <space:1>
     * <blue>dog
     * <space:3></blue>
     * <red>ate</red>
     * <space:1>
     * the
     * <space:1>
     * <yellow>cat</yellow>.
     * 
     * The rule for the wrapping logic will be that whitespace that is to be skipped has the spaces removed, but the rest
     * of the component remains intact. Whether the formatting information is part of the end of the previous line, or the
     * beginning of the next line is a problem for the wrapper. Arguably, however, the beginning of the text that followed the
     * whitespace is probably the most appropriate position. This will only change the output if spaces were included at the
     * beginning or end of a block of coloured text.
