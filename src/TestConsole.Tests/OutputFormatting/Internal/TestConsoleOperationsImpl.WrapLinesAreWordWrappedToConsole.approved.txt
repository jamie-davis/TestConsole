Normal adapter:                                             
-->                                                         
Long console output that should require word wrapping to fit
the display width, but remain short of the line end to      
illustrate WrapLine.                                        
More output, and hopefully more wrapping. Must ensure that  
there is enough text. Also WrapLine'd.                      
No wrapping needed.
